# quantum-secure-multicloud-ledger
Quantum-secure multi-cloud file protection system using AES-256, post-quantum cryptography (ML-KEM, ML-DSA), biometric authentication, and Hyperledger Fabric. The prototype provides tamper-evident key management, passwordless access, and resilient multi-cloud storage with experimental performance evaluation.
