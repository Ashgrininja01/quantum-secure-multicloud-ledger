## Experimental Setup
- OS: Kali Linux
- CPU: x86_64
- Camera: Logitech Brio 100
- PQC Library: liboqs
- Blockchain: Hyperledger Fabric (simulated ledger)

## Performance Evaluation
### AES-256 Encryption
AES encryption time scales linearly with file size...

### Biometric Authentication
Face authentication achieved 100% acceptance below threshold 0.75...

### Post-Quantum Cryptography
Kyber key encapsulation adds minimal overhead (<5 ms)...

### Multi-Cloud Replication
GCP showed lowest latency compared to AWS and Azure...

## Discussion
The proposed system achieves strong security guarantees with acceptable overhead...
